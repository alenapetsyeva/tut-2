## Details
### You will learn  
In this tutorial, you will connect and configure your Tessel device.......

Prior to starting this tutorial you should have your Tessel device and a USB cable. For Windows machines simply plugging in the device will often result in the drivers be installed whereas a Apple Mac OS X or Linux machine require a bit more effort to install.

You should also be familiar with working with the command prompt in Windows or the Terminal or Shell in Mac or Linux.


### Time to Complete
**15 Min**.

---

1. Refer to the Tessel website <http://start.tessel.io/install> for detailed information on getting your Tessel connected for your operating system.    

2. Once you have Node.js installed and the Tessel driver installed, now ensure your Tessel is plugged in via the USB cable and then you should be able to run the following command (this will be from either the CMD prompt in Windows or the Terminal or Shell in Mac or Linux)

    `tessel update --force`
3. Once your Tessel has been connected and you’ve checked to ensure the firmware is up to date you can run other commands such as:

    `tessel version`

    Which will tell you the version of your Tessel device which can be important depending on the project you have in mind.


2. Now that your device is connected you can write your first JavaScript application and execute it on our device.
    The first application to write is `blinky.js` this makes the on-board LED’s of the device blink rapidly. The code is rather simple and more information can be found here: <http://start.tessel.io/blinky>.

    Before you run this code, you do need to ensure that you have a proper text editor or preferably a code editor installed. There are several options for this such as `Chocolat` for Mac OS X or `Notepad++` you can use any but something designed for code and syntax highlighting is ideal.

    Code for this small JavaScript application is simple and straight forward but you do need to understand some basics of the language.

3. Create a new folder named `tessel-code` on your hard drive (in a `dev` folder or some place easy to find).

4. Inside the `tessel-code` folder, create a new file named `blinky.js`.


5. Once you create the file add the following code to it:

    ```
    // Import the interface to Tessel hardware
    var tessel = require('tessel');
    // Set the led pins as outputs with initial states
    var led1 = tessel.led[0].output(1);
    var led2 = tessel.led[1].output(0);
    setInterval(function () {
        console.log("I'm blinking! (Press CTRL + C to stop)");
        // Toggle the led states
        led1.toggle();
        led2.toggle();
    }, 100);
    ```

6. Now go to your command prompt, Terminal or shell and change to the `tessel-code` folder. Often times this is accomplished with the `cd` command for change directory.

7. Once in that directory, run the command `dir` (Windows) or `ls` (Mac/Linux) to show the files in the folder and ensure your `blinky.js` file is there.


8. If it is then you are in the right place and you can now execute the command to have the Tessel device run the application.
    `tessel run blinky.js`

    If you are successful then you should see two small LEDs on the device rapidly turning on and off. If so you are now ready to explore different modules with your Tessel device.

    >For extra credit, modify `blinky.js` so the lights blink in unison.

9. Modules and sensors are components that connect to the device and provide additional functionality and produce data. Three of these sensors are the Climate, Ambient and Accelerometer.
    While you can try any of the sensors on hand it is highly recommend you start with one of these 3 sensors.

    In particular the Climate and Ambient sensors you will enhance later in the exercises to provide data to our SAP HANA system.

    - <http://start.tessel.io/modules/climate>
    - <http://start.tessel.io/modules/ambient>
    - <http://start.tessel.io/modules/accelerometer>

    > When working with the different modules you should create a separate folder under your `tessel-code` folder, the reason for this is that when you install the libraries for the module it’s best to do this in a new directory because when you create your JavaScript code and then run that on the device it deploys the libraries at the same time and thus best to not have everything inside the same exact folder.
