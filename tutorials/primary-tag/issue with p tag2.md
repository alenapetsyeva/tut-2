## Next Steps

## Details

### You will learn
When you built the app in previous tutorial series, the template added two fields in the detail view header (`UnitsInStock` and `UnitsOnOrder`). Those fields appear in the detail view without labels, so you will add some for them.

 ![Application fields requiring labels](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hcp-webide-add-labels-field/mob2-1_0.png)

To explore a bit more of SAP Web IDE, you will use the Web IDE search feature to identify which file to edit.

You will also learn how to add a field to your app. This is useful since the template can quickly generate a working app for you, but you are not restricted to what it generates.

### Time to Complete
